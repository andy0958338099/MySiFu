# Project Requirements Document (PRD) for Sudoku Demon

## 1. Project Overview

Sudoku Demon is a feature-rich mobile app designed for Sudoku enthusiasts of all ages, with a special focus on young players. This app brings classic puzzle fun into the modern age by offering multiple difficulty levels, daily challenges, intelligent hints, progress saving, and a dark mode option—all wrapped in a clean and intuitive interface. The key innovation in this project is the integration of GPT-4, which not only generates unique puzzles but also provides smart hints and solving techniques, thus catering to both beginners and more experienced players.

The app is being built to provide a seamless and engaging Sudoku experience on both iOS and Android platforms using modern development practices. The core objectives are to create an easy-to-navigate app that appeals to children, ensure smooth social authentication (via Google, Facebook, and Instagram), and offer dynamic puzzle generation combined with a competitive daily challenge environment completely managed by a robust backend (Supabase). Success will be measured by user engagement, smooth performance, and ease-of-use for the target audience.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   Development of a mobile app using React Native with TypeScript to support both iOS and Android.
*   Multiple difficulty levels for Sudoku puzzles (from easy to expert).
*   Daily challenge mode with competitive leaderboards.
*   Interactive game board where users can input numbers, request hints, and see their progress auto-saved.
*   A robust hint system enriched with GPT-4 that offers intelligent hints, puzzle generation, and solving techniques.
*   Social login authentication (Google, Facebook, Instagram) for account creation and secure user data management.
*   A settings page for customizing difficulty, toggling hints and themes (including dark mode), and displaying game statistics.
*   Integration of in-app advertisements as a monetization strategy.
*   Backend support powered by Supabase for managing user profiles, high scores, and game states.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Offline gameplay capability (all progress saving and game features depend on a connection to Supabase).
*   Multiplayer modes and advanced analytics—these are planned for future scalability.
*   Detailed legal, accessibility, or compliance measures (e.g., GDPR, WCAG) beyond standard best practices.
*   Overly complex UI/UX branding elements as there are currently no strict color schemes, fonts, or logos mandated.

## 3. User Flow

A new user launching Sudoku Demon is greeted by an inviting onboarding screen tailored especially for children. The first step is a simple authentication using social logins (Google, Facebook, or Instagram), which quickly takes the user to their personalized profile stored securely in Supabase. This streamlined process ensures that even young players can start playing without unnecessary delays or complications.

After authentication, the user is directed to the main menu where options are clearly displayed: starting a new game, resuming a saved game, or entering the daily challenge. Once a game is started, the user lands on the interactive game board—a clean Sudoku grid where numbers can be input using touch-friendly controls. The app auto-saves progress, and users can request hints provided by GPT-4 if they get stuck. Post-game, players can visit the Leaderboard for daily challenge rankings or dive into the Settings page to adjust game preferences and view detailed performance statistics.

    *   The integration with GPT-4 requires access to the GPT-4o model and may be subject to its API rate limits.

*   **Connectivity:**

    *   Continuous internet connection is assumed for game progress saving and obtaining real-time data from the backend.

*   **User Base:**

    *   The primary target audience is young users (“小朋友”), and the UI/UX will be tailored to be simple and engaging for children.

*   **Assumptions in Development:**

    *   Future integrations, like multiplayer modes and complex analytics, are not part of the initial release but will be structured for scalability.
    *   There is no need for offline functionality as all critical features require Supabase connectivity.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits & Service Availability:**

    *   GPT-4 integration might encounter API rate limits during high usage. Establishing caching strategies for puzzle generation and hints may help mitigate this.
    *   Supabase connectivity issues may affect real-time saving and leaderboard updates. Implement sensible error handling and user notifications.

*   **Social Login Complexities:**

    *   Managing authentication across multiple social platforms (Google, Facebook, Instagram) on mobile can be challenging due to differing SDK requirements and potential API changes.
    *   Ensuring secure and seamless integration will require thorough testing on both iOS and Android.

*   **Performance on Lower-End Devices:**

    *   Given that the app targets young users, it is important to optimize the app so it runs smoothly on devices that may have limited processing power.
    *   Use appropriate lazy loading and code-splitting strategies where possible.

*   **UI/UX Challenges:**

    *   Designing an intuitive interface that appeals to young users without being overly simplistic may require iterative user testing.
    *   Special attention must be given to font sizes, button placements, and overall touch responsiveness.

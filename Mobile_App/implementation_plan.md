# Implementation Plan for Sudoku Demon

This implementation plan is organized into five phases. Each step includes a single action with references to the project documents and file paths where applicable.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  **Install and Configure Tools**: Install Node.js (latest LTS) and the React Native CLI. Ensure you have Xcode (for iOS) and Android Studio (for Android) installed. (PRD Section 1, Tech Stack Document)
2.  **Initialize the Mobile Project**: Run `npx react-native init SudokuDemon --template react-native-template-typescript` to create a new React Native project with TypeScript. (PRD Section 1, starter_tech_stack_document.md)
3.  **Set Up Version Control**: Initialize a Git repository in the project root and create `main` and `dev` branches. (PRD Section 1.4)
4.  **Configure Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file at the project root to store Supabase keys and GPT-4 credentials. (PRD Section 3; file: `./.env`)
5.  **Validation**: Run `git status` and check that the project structure is set up correctly and the `.env` file is present.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  **Install Dependencies**: Add required packages including React Navigation, social authentication libraries (for Google, Facebook, Instagram), and any UI libraries needed (Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS). (Tech Stack Document, PRD Section 4)
2.  **Configure Tailwind CSS**: Follow Tailwind CSS integration for React Native and configure according to project requirements. (frontend_guidelines_document)
3.  **Set Up Navigation**: Create an `AppNavigator.tsx` file in `/src/navigation/` to configure React Navigation with routes for Onboarding, Main Menu, Game Board, Settings, and Leaderboard screens. (App Flow Section: Main Menu Navigation)
4.  **Create Onboarding Screen**: In `/src/screens/OnboardingScreen.tsx`, develop a screen that welcomes users and offers social login options (Google, Facebook, Instagram). (PRD Section 3, User Flow)
5.  **Implement Social Authentication**: Code social login functionality in the Onboarding screen using the chosen social auth libraries and integrate with Supabase authentication. (PRD Section 3, Q&A: Authentication Methods)
6.  **Create Main Menu Screen**: In `/src/screens/MainMenuScreen.tsx`, display options for new game, resume game, and daily challenge. (PRD Section 3, App Flow: Main Menu Navigation)
7.  **Develop Game Board Screen**: In `/src/screens/GameBoardScreen.tsx`, build the interactive Sudoku grid component. Create a reusable Sudoku grid component in `/src/components/SudokuGrid.tsx`. (PRD Section 3, App Flow: Interactive Game Play)
8.  **Integrate GPT-4 for Puzzle Generation and Hints**: In `/src/services/gptService.ts`, implement functions to call the GPT-4 API for generating puzzles and providing intelligent hints. (PRD Section 4, Q&A: GPT-4 Integration)
9.  **Create Settings Screen**: In `/src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx`, implement options to adjust difficulty, toggle dark mode, and view game statistics. (PRD Section 3, App Flow: Settings and Advanced Features)
10. **Create Leaderboard Screen**: In `/src/screens/LeaderboardScreen.tsx`, design a UI to display daily challenge rankings and high scores along with integrated ad placements. (PRD Section 3, Core Features: Daily Challenges & Leaderboards)
11. **Validation**: Run the app on both iOS and Android emulators and navigate through all screens to verify proper rendering and functionality.

## Phase 3: Backend Development

1.  **Set Up Supabase Project**: Create a new Supabase project and note the endpoint and API keys. (Tech Stack Document, PRD Section 5)
2.  **Create Database Tables**: In Supabase, define tables for `users`, `games`, and `leaderboard` with appropriate schemas. (PRD Section 2, Backend Structure Document)
3.  **Configure Supabase Authentication**: Enable social authentication (Google, Facebook, Instagram) in the Supabase dashboard. (PRD Section 3, Q&A: Authentication Methods)
4.  **Develop Puzzle Generation Function**: Create a serverless function in Supabase functions (e.g., `/supabase/functions/generatePuzzle/index.ts`) that leverages GPT-4 to generate unique puzzles. (PRD Section 4, App Flow: Interactive Game Play)
5.  **Implement Auto-Save and Game State APIs**: Create API endpoints using Supabase Edge Functions to save and fetch game states. (PRD Section 3, Backend Structure Document)
6.  **Set Up Leaderboard API**: Develop an endpoint to retrieve and update daily challenge rankings stored in the `leaderboard` table. (PRD Section 3, Core Features: Daily Challenges & Leaderboards)
7.  **Validation**: Test each endpoint using Postman or curl to ensure proper responses and data handling.

## Phase 4: Integration

1.  **Integrate Supabase with Frontend Authentication**: In the Onboarding screen, connect the social login buttons to Supabase authentication methods. (PRD Section 3, Q&A: Authentication Methods)
2.  **Hook Up Game Board Auto-Save**: In `GameBoardScreen.tsx`, implement calls to the auto-save API for real-time game state updates to Supabase. (PRD Section 3, App Flow: Interactive Game Play)
3.  **Integrate GPT-4 Hint System**: Connect the GPT-4 service functions from `/src/services/gptService.ts` with the Game Board to provide intelligent hints. (PRD Section 4, Q&A: GPT-4 Integration)
4.  **Display Real-Time Leaderboard Data**: In the Leaderboard screen, fetch leaderboard data from Supabase and display it along with integrated ad placements. (PRD Section 3, Core Features: Daily Challenges & Leaderboards)
5.  **Validation**: Perform end-to-end testing by registering via social login, starting a game, triggering auto-save, requesting hints, and verifying leaderboard updates.

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  **Prepare Mobile Builds**: Configure native build settings for both iOS and Android. For iOS, configure signing certificates in Xcode; for Android, set up the keystore in the project settings. (PRD Section 1, Non-Functional Requirements)
2.  **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline**: Configure a GitHub Actions workflow to run tests and build the app automatically on commits to the `dev` branch. (Tech Stack Document, PRD Section 7)
3.  **Integrate Over-The-Air Updates**: Set up CodePush or a similar service to manage over-the-air updates for mobile deployments. (PRD Section 7, Future Scalability)
4.  **Deploy Supabase Functions**: Push and deploy all Supabase functions (e.g., puzzle generation) using Supabase CLI to production. (PRD Section 5, Backend Structure Document)
5.  **Configure Monitoring and Analytics**: Set up basic logging and error tracking (using a tool like Sentry) to monitor app performance post-deployment. (PRD Section 7, Non-Functional Requirements)
6.  **Validation**: Perform a full test by deploying a beta version to a small group of users, and verify that authentication, game saving, puzzle generation, hint functionality, and leaderboard updates work correctly on actual devices.

This plan covers the key steps required to implement Sudoku Demon according to the PRD and tech stack requirements. Each step has been designed for clarity and focus to ensure that the mobile app is developed in compliance with all outlined specifications.

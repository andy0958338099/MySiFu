# App Flow Document: Sudoku Demon

## Introduction

This document explains the complete flow of Sudoku Demon, a mobile app designed for Sudoku lovers with an emphasis on younger users. The app combines the thrill of traditional Sudoku puzzles with modern technology, including social logins, GPT-4 intelligence for dynamic puzzle generation and hints, and real-time progress saving using Supabase. The main goal is to provide a simple, engaging, and challenging experience where every element, from starting the game to showing statistics and handling errors, interconnects smoothly and intuitively.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user first opens Sudoku Demon, they are welcomed by an inviting onboarding screen that highlights ease of use, especially for children. The screen gives a quick introduction to the appâ€™s key features such as multiple difficulty levels, daily challenges, and intelligent hints powered by GPT-4. New users then proceed to the account creation step where they can sign up using social logins like Google, Facebook, or Instagram. This process connects securely to Supabase for backend data management. For returning users, a straightforward sign-in interface enables quick access using the same social platforms. If a user forgets their password, the app offers a recovery option that guides them step by step through resetting their credentials. At any point, users can sign out through an accessible option available on the main menu.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After signing in, users are led directly to the main menu, which is the central hub of Sudoku Demon. The home screen is designed with large, touch-friendly elements. At the top of the screen, users see a concise header with options to navigate to different sections such as new game, saved game, and daily challenge. The interface is clean and straightforward, featuring clear icons and text that resonate especially well with younger audiences. The main dashboard also provides an unobtrusive view of advertisements, ensuring the flow is not interrupted. This central page makes it clear how to transition to other parts of the app, whether it is launching a new puzzle or checking the leaderboard rankings from the daily challenge section.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When a user decides to start a new game or join the daily challenge, they transition to the interactive game board. This page displays a full-screen Sudoku grid where numbers can be entered using a touch-friendly interface. Here, the user enjoys dynamic puzzle generation, driven by GPT-4 to ensure every game is unique and challenging. If the user finds themselves stuck, a hint button is available that connects to GPT-4 to offer subtle clues and problem-solving tips. The game board auto-saves progress in real time via Supabase, letting users pause and later resume their game without any hassle. Once the game session concludes, users can view a detailed summary of their performance. If they opt into the daily challenge, they will immediately see a leaderboard on a new page that displays current rankings and scores, fostering a spirit of competition. The transition within the app is smooth, with clear navigation cues that allow users to easily return to the main menu or jump directly to the puzzle grid from a notification or an in-game prompt.

## Settings and Account Management

Accessing the settings page is simple from the main navigation menu. On this page, users can adjust various preferences such as the difficulty level of puzzles, whether hints should be automatically suggested, and if they want to enable dark mode for night-time play. This section also provides detailed game statistics, showing information like average puzzle completion time and hint usage, which informs users about their progress and improvement over time. In addition, account management options are built into this area. Users can update their personal information, manage linked social accounts, and verify subscription details if they have opted into additional features. Upon completing any changes, a visible option allows them to save and exit back to the main flow without losing context of where they were in the app.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Sudoku Demon anticipates common user issues and incorporates clear error states to help users return to a normal flow. If a user inputs invalid data in the puzzle grid or selects an unavailable option, a friendly error message will be displayed clearly on the current screen along with guidance on how to correct the issue. In case of connectivity problems with Supabase, the app is designed to inform users of the issue with a concise message and suggest checking the internet connection. Even when the app runs into unexpected problems, there are fallback pages that allow users to navigate to safe sections like the main menu or settings. The error handling is robust, ensuring that no matter what the issue is, users always have a clear path to resume their activities or find help.

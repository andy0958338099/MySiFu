# Tech Stack Document

## Introduction

Sudoku Demon is a feature-packed mobile app built for Sudoku lovers of all ages, especially designed with young players in mind. The app offers multiple difficulty levels, daily challenges, interactive game boards, and a smart hint system powered by GPT-4. By combining modern technologies and user-friendly designs, the app aims to provide a seamless and engaging puzzle experience on both iOS and Android devices. In this document, we explain each technology choice in simple everyday language so that everyone can understand how they come together to make Sudoku Demon both fun and reliable.

## Frontend Technologies

The look and feel of the app are built using React Native with TypeScript. This combination ensures the app works smoothly on both iOS and Android devices. React Native makes it possible to create engaging native experiences with a single code base, while TypeScript adds a layer of clarity and safety by catching mistakes early. To make the app look modern and clean, we use Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI. Tailwind CSS is a styling tool that helps us build a visually appealing interface quickly, and Shadcn UI provides reusable components that maintain consistency throughout the app. These choices ensure that the app is not only visually attractive but also easy to navigate, especially for young users.

## Backend Technologies

On the backend, Supabase is our go-to choice for managing the app’s data needs. Supabase handles everything from user profiles and saving game states to tracking high scores. Its secure platform ensures that important user data is well protected, while also offering smooth and real-time data updates. Additionally, GPT-4 integration is leveraged for generating unique puzzles and offering intelligent hints. This blend of tools helps keep the app dynamic and responsive while making sure every game session is fresh and challenging.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

To keep the app running smoothly and securely, we rely on modern infrastructure and deployment tools. The development process uses Vite, a fast replacement for older build tools, which speeds up development and testing. For version control and collaboration, we use trusted platforms with integrated CI/CD pipelines that make deploying updates quick and reliable. This ensures that every new feature or fix is rolled out with minimal disruption, keeping the user experience consistent and high-quality, no matter how many new updates are made.

## Third-Party Integrations

Sudoku Demon is enhanced with several third-party integrations that add significant value to the user experience. Social logins via Google, Facebook, and Instagram simplify the process of signing up and securing user accounts by minimizing the need to remember passwords. The integration with GPT-4 is another key feature; it not only generates new puzzles but also provides smart hints and detailed explanations of solving strategies. In-app advertisements are thoughtfully integrated to support monetization without compromising on gameplay. Together, these integrations ensure a smooth experience while also opening avenues for future enhancements and scalability.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Security and performance have been important parts of every decision. Social logins and Supabase work hand-in-hand to provide a secure user data management system, ensuring that all profile details and game progress are stored safely. We make sure that updates and communications between the app and the server are efficient and real-time so that users do not face interruptions during gameplay. Additionally, tools and best practices in coding help optimize the app, resulting in fast load times and fluid transitions. These measures contribute to a trustworthy and consistently good experience for all users.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

In summary, the tech stack for Sudoku Demon has been carefully chosen to balance modern design, robust functionality, and forward-looking scalability. On the frontend, React Native with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI come together to deliver a user-friendly, visually appealing interface that works seamlessly on both mobile platforms. On the backend, Supabase and GPT-4 power the app’s core features—from secure authentication to dynamic puzzle creation and intelligent hints. With strong infrastructure support and thoughtful third-party integrations upholding security and performance, the project is well-equipped to deliver a compelling and enjoyable Sudoku experience from day one. This carefully aligned set of technologies not only meets the current requirements but also lays a solid foundation for the app’s future growth.
